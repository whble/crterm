# CRTERM - Linux

CRTerm runs in Linux.

It requires Mono. To get the latest mono dev kit, see:
https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin

You can compile CRTerm with MonoDevelop, available here:
https://www.monodevelop.com/

I plan to do a binary release of CRTerm, packaged for Windows and Linux, when it's 1.0-ready.
