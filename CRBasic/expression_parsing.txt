Expression Parsing

Expressions are parsed from left to right and are progressively evaluated by simplifying the expression until it has been reduced to a single term. 

OOP:
Function call
()
^
*, /
+, -
AND
OR
NOT

function calls are tokenized; values >= 81h are BASIC tokens. 

read next symbol in list
  if the symbol is a function call or (, evaluate substring to next ) and replace sequence with result of function call
  reduce all ^ (exponent) operations
  reduce * and / operations, left to right
  reduce + and - operations, left to right
  reduce AND operations, left to right
  reduce OR  operations, left to right
  reduce NOT operations, left to right

for each level of OOP
read value 1
read operator
read value 2
peform the operation and replace with the result
